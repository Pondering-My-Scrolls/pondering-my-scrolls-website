## Introduction and background

Working on this website with a goal of meeting as many WCAG AAA criteria as possible meant we had to be diligent with checking content before we post it. We formed a checklist out of this goal, and want to share our process for making “blog post” style web content as accessible as we know how to. 

## Intention

This list is not intended to be a stand-alone accessibility plan. It can be used as a starting point to build your own web accessibility plan and meet the goals you set. Our list is also published to incorporate transparency of how we approach web accessibility. 

## The checklist

The list is structured in what we think is the most logical order to complete.

### Media

- **No embedded content**, including: iFrames, audio-only, video-only, or time-based media.
- **No flashing** content.
- **No images of text** other than logos and required branding.
- **Provide text alternatives** for any non-text content.

### Design & Structure

- **Do not use colour** alone as information.
- **New colours must pass** contrast ratio thresholds.
- **Headings** need to be placed often where they makes sense. They should be brief, and describe the topic or purpose.

### Links

- **Do not open links in a new tab or window**, which introduces a change of context.
- **Describe the link destination** in the link text.
- **Links that go to the same destination** should be consistently named across pages.

### Language

- **Language changes** need to be marked up with the correct BCP 47 language tag.
- **Abbreviations and acronyms** must be spelled out on their first use.
- **Ambiguous words** should be marked up to provide their pronunciation, or, there should be context for the meaning to be distinguished.

#### Reading Level

Anything more complex than “Grade 9” reading level must have a simple version, or alternative content. Please remove any proper names and titles when testing. 

Some decisions require careful consideration of context and nuances, including:

- Determining how reading level is calculated.
- Choosing how to remediate:
    - Simplified version,
    - Supplementing the original content,
    - Providing a summary.

### Code/Markup

- **Use correct and semantic** HTML tags.
- **Correctly order headings**.
