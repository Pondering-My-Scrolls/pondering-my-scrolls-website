            <h2>Nicky Wolfe (any/all pronouns)</h2>
            <p>
                In a world where the mundane reigns supreme, Nicky Wolfe is a frontend developer
                who isn't afraid to stand in their truth and commit to making a truly exemplary digital product.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gifted with a special interest in accessibility and efficiency, and an innate love of pondering orbs
                research projects, it was Nicky's idea to make a website where they and Jenica could write about what
                matters in tech today.
            </p>
            <p>With a little bit of time and planning, the core concept of Pondering my Scrolls was formed over a shared plate of fries at a local diner.</p>

            <h2>Jenica Woitowicz (she/her)</h2>
            <p>When a high intelligence modifier is paired with hard work, you get Jenica Woitowicz!</p>
            <p>
                Also a frontend developer, Jenica is someone who loves to keep up to date on digital subjects. That
                could be anything from
                cutting-edge accessibility to how wonky the next dog robot looks wonky.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jenica's strategy for making Pondering My Scrolls was to keep all the early planning notes in an ancient
                mutilated notebook, and to kill her darlings as much as needed to make a straightforward product that
                can offer some delight. And if you're reading this now, then that strategy probably paid off!
