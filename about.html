                <p>Nicky Wolfe (all pronouns) is a web developer who is confident and unafraid in speaking their truth
                    in order to create great projects. Nicky’s special interest is web accessibility and research

                <p>Jenica Woitowicz (she/her) is a web developer who loves to stay up to date on the digital world. Her
                    interests range from web accessibility to funny robot dogs. She hopes that you find Pondering My

                <p>The Pondering My Scrolls project was created while Jenica and Nicky were chatting at a diner. It is a
                    blog for ideas that we haven’t been able to write about yet. We will write about what we think
                    matters most in tech right now.</p>

                In a world where the mundane reigns supreme, Nicky Wolfe is a frontend developer who isn't afraid to
                stand in their truth to create otherworldly results.

                With a special interest in accessibility, and an innate love of <del>pondering orbs</del> research projects,
                Pondering My Scrolls was born: a resting place for trapped ideas about what matters in tech right now.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a little bit of time and planning, the core concept of Pondering my Scrolls was formed over a
                shared plate of fries and killer milkshakes at a local diner.

            </p>
            <p>
                Also a frontend developer, Jenica is someone who loves to keep up to date on digital subjects. That
                could be anything from cutting-edge accessibility to how wonky the next dog robot looks wonky.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jenica's strategy for making Pondering My Scrolls was to keep all the early planning notes in an ancient
                mutilated notebook, and to kill her darlings as much as needed to make a straightforward product that
                can offer some delight. And if you're reading this now, then that strategy probably paid off!
