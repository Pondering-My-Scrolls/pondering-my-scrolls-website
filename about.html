                In a world where the mundane reigns supreme, Nicky Wolfe is a frontend developer who isn't afraid to
                stand in their truth to create otherworldly results.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gifted with a special interest in accessibility, and an innate love of pondering orbs research projects,
                Pondering My Scrolls was born: a resting place for trapped ideas about what matters in tech right now.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a little bit of time and planning, the core concept of Pondering my Scrolls was formed over a
                shared plate of fries and killer milkshakes at a local diner.

                When a high intelligence modifier is paired with hard work, you get Jenica Woitowicz.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also a frontend developer, Jenica is someone who loves to keep up to date on digital subjects. That
                could be anything from cutting-edge accessibility to how wonky the next dog robot looks wonky.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jenica's strategy for making Pondering My Scrolls was to keep all the early planning notes in an ancient
                mutilated notebook, and to kill her darlings as much as needed to make a straightforward product that
                can offer some delight. And if you're reading this now, then that strategy probably paid off!
